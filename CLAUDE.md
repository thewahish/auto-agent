# AutoAgent

## About
AutoAgent is an experimental research project exploring the development of autonomous AI agent systems capable of executing complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human supervision. The project investigates architectures for self-directed AI agents that can plan actions, execute tool calls, evaluate results, and iterate toward goal completion across various domains.

The research covers agent orchestration patterns, memory systems for maintaining context across long-running tasks, tool integration frameworks, and safety mechanisms for bounded autonomy. Drawing from current advances in large language models and agentic AI frameworks, the project aims to develop practical implementations that can automate routine development, content creation, and system administration tasks.

Development began in January 2026 as a forward-looking research initiative within the OBAI Ecosystem. Currently in the conceptualization phase at 0% completion, the project will document findings from experiments with existing agent frameworks, prototype custom agent implementations, and establish guidelines for safe and effective autonomous AI deployment in production environments.
